//Family age problem overview

//Write an efficient algorithm to calculate the total sum of ages in a family tree. 
//A family tree is a binary search tree in this case where all the nodes contain a Person object with [name,age] attributes.

// Hint: we have to make a tree traversal so the running time of the algoritm will be O(N) linear running time
